# SWHS-RaspPiJavaRobotics

### Presented by [CSE-SouthwestHS](https://github.com/CSE-SouthwestHS)

To our knowledge, this is the first ever complete, open-source curriculum project addressing both AP CSA (Computer Science Applications) and Robotics.  
**Our Mission** to provide an accessible entry point to Robotics programming for students and instructors of College Level Java.

**What Makes This Project Unique**
- Completely self contained.  There are no materials, code, products, or research that are not provided or listed in this repository.
- Low cost.  The robotics hardware in the price list can be purchased for approximately $250.
- Ready for use for students and instructors.  All hardware interface programming is already complete with well documented APIs for higher abstraction development.

# HELP REQUEST
This code is (and probably always will be) under development.  It is fully functional but we invite anyone who would like to offer valuable improvements to please join us.  Fork the repository and send us your Pull Requests!
Currently we are working to improve latency between the Front-end GUI, server, and PWM hardward interface.  Please see the issues posted on the
**[HELP REQUEST BRANCH](https://github.com/CSE-SouthwestHS/SWHS-RaspPiJavaRobotics/blob/HelpRequestWebsocket/README.md)**.
Contributors will be recognized and appreciated!!!

*Price list Notes:*

*The items in this list are the best options for each product that we have found to build a single robot.  There are a few items in this list which are packs containing more items than required for just one robot.  Also, if you plan to build multiple robots, in many cases, larger more cost effective packs can be found by searching for products.  This can make the cost of building multiple robots significantly lower.*
