# UPDATE 5/14/2019

## The master branch is now fully functional!

## Now, the only problem is latency.

If you would like to lend a hand, please checkout the master branch.  
Instructions to run the program are there.

# Current problem
**Latency**  Time between commands on the client, reception on the server and execution can range from instantaneous to 3 or more seconds.  Also, sometimes commands are received out of order.

**Identifying the problem - Theories**  
* Java execution latency due to caching of variables or... ?
* Latency of http transmission from client to server

We greatly appreciate your assistance and insight to improve this code.

Thanks for your help in advance, The Southwest Computer Science Team.
